  ## Description
  This program is a content management system based in Node.js using data from SQL databases and Inquirer prompts to generate tables for departments, roles, and employees.


  ## Install
  In order to use the program, install node packages with "npm init" and install the appropriate packages with "npm install mysql2 inquirer". Use a SQL shell to generate the database and tables with "source db/db.sql" and "source db/schema.sql" commands.
  
  ## Use
  Ensure you have a working version of Node.js and use the command "node index" to initiate the program. When the program starts, the user should see prompts to view tables, add information, update information, and delete information. The selections will then either generate a table or use further prompts to change and generate tables. After this process is complete, the user will then see the original prompts generated.
